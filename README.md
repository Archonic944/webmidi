## Introduction

**WebMidi.js** makes it easy to interact with MIDI instruments directly from a web browser or from 
Node.js. It simplifies the control of physical or virtual MIDI instruments with user-friendly 
functions such as `playNote()`, `setPitchBend()` or `sendControlChange()`. It also allows reacting 
to inbound MIDI messages by adding listeners for events such as `"noteon"`, `"pitchbend"` or 
`"programchange"`.

## Sponsors

WebMidi.js is a passion project but it still takes quite a bit of time to develop and maintain. 
I would like to sincerely thank üëè these sponsors for their support:

If you would like to support the project, you can press the 
[Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/djipco) üíú button at the top of the page.

## Browser Support

The library works in all browsers that natively support the 
[Web MIDI API](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/). Currently, the following major browsers
have native support: 

* Edge
* Chrome
* Opera

It is also possible to use this library in other browsers if you install 
[Jazz-Plugin](https://jazz-soft.net/download/Jazz-Plugin/) v1.4+. This combination provides 
support for the following additional web browsers:

* Firefox
* Safari
* Internet Explorer

Note that, in 2020, [Apple has announced](https://webkit.org/tracking-prevention/) that they would not
natively support the Web MIDI API (and a host of other APIs) in Safari because of fingerprinting 
concerns. 

## Node.js Support

Version 3.0 of WebMidi.js introduced full Node.js support. Nothing special needs to be done, it 
should just work in the following environments:

* GNU/Linux
* macOS
* Windows
* Raspberry Pi

Support for the Node.js environment has been made possible by the good folks of 
[Jazz-Soft](https://jazz-soft.net/) via their [JZZ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jzz) module.

## Flavours

To cater to various needs, WebMidi.js is distributed in 3 different flavours which you can find 
inside the `dist` folder: 

* **Immediately invoked function expression** (IIFE): This version creates a `WebMidi` object 
directly in the global namespace. This is the legacy approach which is often easier for beginners.

* **ES6 Module** (ESM): This is the modern approach which allows you to `import` the objects as
needed.

* **CommonJS Module** (CJS): this is the flavour used by Node.js and often with bundling tools 
such as WebPack.

All 3 flavours also come in a minified version with sourcemap.

## Installation

Depending on your needs and environment, you can install **WebMidi.js** in a variety of different 
ways.

#### CDN

The easiest way to get started is to link the WebMidi.js library from the 
[jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/webmidi) CDN (content delivery network). Just add 
this `<script>` tag to your HTML page:

    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/webmidi@next/dist/webmidi.iife.js"></script>

#### Manual Install

Obviously, you can also install **WebMidi.js** the old-fashioned way by downloading the
[latest release](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/releases) packaged as a zip file. Uncompress the
package, grab the `./dist/webmidi.iife.js` file and copy it to your project. Link to it from your 
HTML page using a `<script>` tag as usual. 

#### NPM Install

Arguably, the easiest approach is to install **WebMidi.js** with NPM. At the root of your project, 
simply issue the following command to perform the install:

    npm install webmidi@next
    
Then, you can use any of those approaches depending on your environment:

    // Script tag
    <script src="node_modules/webmidi/dist/webmidi.iife.js"></script>
 
    // CommonJS require
    const {WebMidi} = require("webmidi");
 
    // ES module import
    import {WebMidi} from "node_modules/webmidi/dist/webmidi.esm.js";

## Insecure Origins

Starting with version 77, 
[Chrome deprecated Web MIDI usage on insecure origins](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5138066234671104). 
This means that, going forward, any page using WebMidi.js will need to be hosted on a secure origin:

* `https://`
* `localhost:`
* `file:///`

Also, the user will need to explicitely authorize usage via a prompt (no matter if system exclusive
messages are used or not).

## Quick Start

Getting started is easy. The first thing to do is to enable **WebMidi.js**. To do that, you call
`WebMidi.enable()` and use `then()` to pass it a function to execute when done:

```javascript
WebMidi
  .enable()
  .then(() => console.log("WebMidi enabled!"))
  .catch(err => alert(err));
```
To interact with devices you need to know which `Input` and `Output` ports are available. Connect a
MIDI device and try the following:

```javascript
WebMidi
  .enable()
  .then(onEnabled)
  .catch(err => alert(err));

function onEnabled() {
  console.log(WebMidi.inputs);
  console.log(WebMidi.outputs);
}
```
You should see your devices appear in the console. As you can probably witness, most MIDI devices 
will make several input and/or output ports available. 

> #### About devices and channels
>
> MIDI input and output ports all have 16 channels. WebMidi.js reflects that. Let's break it down. 
> The `WebMidi.inputs` property contains an array of `Input` objects. These objects have methods
> such as `addListener()` which allows you to listen to inbound MIDI messages on all 16 channels at
> once (or just a subset of channels should you prefer).
>
> Each `Input` object has a `channels` property which is an array of 16 `InputChannel` objects. The 
> `InputChannel` objects also have an `addListener()` method which, in this case, listens for events
> only on that particular channel.

Here is a quick example of how to play a note on MIDI channel 1 of the first found output device 
(port):

```javascript
let synth = WebMidi.outputs[0];
synth.channels[1].playNote("C3");
```

Above, we retrieve the port in the `outputs` array and store it inside the `synth` variable. Then,
we access MIDI channel 1 of the synth and use its `playNote()` method.

Since the position of devices in the array could change, it is often better to use the device's 
name (as displayed in the `WebMidi.outputs` array):

```javascript
let synth = WebMidi.getOutputByName("Axiom Pro 25 Ext Out");
synth.channels[1].playNote("C3");
```

Receiving MIDI messages works in a similar way: you retrieve the input device and channel you want 
to use, and then add a callback function to be triggered when a specific MIDI message is received on 
the desired channel.

For example, to listen for pitch bend events on channel 1 of the selected port:

```javascript
let input = WebMidi.getInputByName("Axiom Pro 25 USB A In");
let channel = input.channels[1]; // channel 1

channel.addListener('pitchbend', e => {
 console.log("Pitch value: " + e.value);
});
```

## API Documentation

The [API for WebMidi.js](https://webmidijs.org/docs/) is fully documented and I take 
pride in maintaining good API documentation. If you spot an error (even something minor) or think a 
topic should be made clearer, do not hesitate to 
[file an issue](https://github.com/djipco/webmidi/issues) or, better yet, send a PR. 

Here is a link to the full
**[API Reference](https://webmidijs.org/docs/)**. You can also find the API reference inside the 
`docs` folder.

## More Code Examples

Here are various other examples to give you an idea of what is possible with WebMidi.js. All the 
examples below only work if WebMidi.js has been properly enabled.

#### View available ports

```javascript
WebMidi.enable().then(() => {
    console.log(WebMidi.inputs);
    console.log(WebMidi.outputs);
});
```
#### Retrieve ports returned by promise

```javascript
WebMidi.enable().then(ports => {
    console.log("WebMidi.js has been enabled!");
    console.log("Inputs: ", ports.inputs);
    console.log("Outputs: ", ports.outputs);
})
```
#### Retrieve the current time

This can be useful if you want to schedule playback of a note somewhere in the future. The time is
in milliseconds (decimal) relative to the navigation start of the document.

```javascript
WebMidi.enable().then(ports => {
  console.log(WebMidi.time);
})
```
#### Retrieve an output port/device using its id, name or array index

Different ways to retrive an output. Beware that IDs are different from one platform to another. 

```javascript
let output1 = WebMidi.getOutputById("123456789");
let output2 = WebMidi.getOutputByName("Axiom Pro 25 Ext Out");
let output3 = WebMidi.outputs[0];
```

#### Play a note on a specific MIDI channel (1)

The `channels` property of an `Output` object contains references to 16 `OutputChannel` objects 
(1-16).

```javascript
let output = WebMidi.outputs[0];
let channel = output.channels[1];
channel.playNote("C3");
```

#### Play a note on multiple channels at once

You can call `playNote()` (and various other methods) directly on the `Output` object. This allows 
you to play a note on several channels at once. 

```javascript
let output = WebMidi.outputs[0];
output.playNote("Gb4", [1, 2, 3]);
```

#### Play a chord on a specific MIDI channel (1)

You can pass an array of notes to play to the `playNote()` method.

```javascript
let output = WebMidi.outputs[0];
let channel = output.channels[1];
channel.playNote(["C3", "D#3", "G3"]);
```

#### Control note velocity

You can control attack and release velocites when playing a note by using the `options` parameter.

```javascript
let output = WebMidi.outputs[0];
let channel = output.channels[1];
channel.playNote("C3", {attack: 0.5});
```

#### Specify note duration

If you specify a duration (in decimal milliseconds) for the note, it will be automatically stopped 
after duration has expired.

```javascript
let output = WebMidi.outputs[0];
let channel = output.channels[1];
channel.playNote("C3", {duration: 1000});
```

#### Schedule notes

You can specify an absolute or relative time to schedule note playback in the future:

```javascript
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[1].playNote("C3", {time: WebMidi.time + 3000});
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[1].playNote("C3", {time: "+2000"});
```

#### Manually stopping playback

You can specify stop playback of a note right away or in the future.

```javascript
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[1].stopNote("C3");
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[1].stopNote("C3", {time: "+2500"});
```

#### Set polyphonic aftertouch 

Send polyphonic aftertouch message to channel 8

```javascript
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[8].setKeyAftertouch("B#3", 0.25);
```

#### Set pitch bend value

The value is between -1 and 1 (a value of 0 means no bend).

```javascript
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[8].setPitchBend(-0.25);
```

#### Use Chained Methods

The value is between -1 and 1 (a value of 0 means no bend).

```javascript
WebMidi.outputs[0].channels[8]
    .setPitchBend(-0.25)
    .playNote("F4");
```

#### Retrieve Input by Name, ID or Index

The value is between -1 and 1 (a value of 0 means no bend).

```javascript
let output1 = WebMidi.getInputById("123456789");
let output2 = WebMidi.getInputByName("nanoKEY2 KEYBOARD");
let output3 = WebMidi.inputs[0];
```

#### Listen to event on single channel

```javascript
WebMidi.inputs[0].channels[1].addListener("noteon", e => {
  console.log(`Received 'noteon' message (${e.note.name}${e.note.octave}).`);
});
```

#### Listen to event on multiple channels at once

```javascript
WebMidi.inputs[0].addListener("controlchange", e => {
  console.log(`Received 'controlchange' message.`, e);
}, {channels: [1, 2, 3]});
```

#### Check for the presence of an event listener

```javascript
let channel = WebMidi.inputs[0].channels[1];
let test = e => console.log(e);
channel.addListener('programchange', test);
console.log("Has event listener: ", channel.hasListener('programchange', test));
```

#### Remove listeners

```javascript
let channel = WebMidi.inputs[0].channels[1];
let test = e => console.log(e);
channel.removeListener("noteoff", test);  // specifically this one
channel.removeListener("noteoff");        // all noteoff on this channel
channel.removeListener();                 // all listeners
```

## About Sysex Support

Per the 
[Web MIDI API specification](https://webaudio.github.io/web-midi-api/#dom-navigator-requestmidiaccess), 
system exclusive (sysex) support is disabled by default. If you need to use sysex messages, you will 
need to explicitly enable them:

```javascript
WebMidi.enable({sysex: true});
```
